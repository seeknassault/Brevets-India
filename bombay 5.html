   <h1><center> A COMMUNICATOR FOR CHILDREN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY</center></h1>
Survival and communication are complementary to each other. Cerebral Palsy
being a major neuromuscular disorder, children suffering from this require a
special type of communicator for their existence. Based on a concept developed by a teacher and therapist at the Happy Hours Centre, Khar, Mumbai,
Prof. G. G. Ray of Industrial Design Centre with his colleague at Department of
Electrical Engineering worked towards developing a special type of communicating tool based on a personal computer which can be foot operated. Initially
the product will act as training equipment but once the child becomes master
in using the system, it can act as a communicator.
The input to the computer can be given through a specially developed Foot
Operated Switches (FOS) in conjunction with specially developed software to
cater the need of such children who can neither speak nor have control over their
body movements except a marginally better control over the leg and toe tip muscles. A special sequence of function based keywords like 'Do', 'Go', 'Drink', etc. were developed so that
minimum efforts were required to express their needs. Those keywords were structured for
different levels of hierarchy and were presented with images of the respective situations.
Along with the FOS and software, a special type of furniture was also developed for positioning the monitor and FOS for their safe operation while the child was on wheel chair.<br>
