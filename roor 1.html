   <h1><center> SILICON LOCKET FOR CARDIAC MONITORING</center></h1>
For mobile monitoring of ECG, a small toffee-sized low-cost locket has
recently been developed by Prof. D. K. Sharma and his colleagues from
Department of Electrical Engineering and colleagues from Department of
Biosciences and Bioengineering and their students by integrating a low
power microcomputer with an indigenously developed operating system,
analog front-end electronics and a re-chargeable battery with an in-built
charger. The system is optimized to acquire a three lead simultaneous
electrocardiogram (ECG), reconfigurable up to 12-leads, and can correct
for motion artefacts arising out of the physical activity of the patient. The
ECG data can be either stored in the Micro Secure Digital card memory,
or transmitted through a phone modem or GPRS network.
An arrhythmia event can be detected in real-time using the built-in algorithms and the system is configured to automatically inform a medical
practitioner through SMS in the event of an arrhythmia. The system also
allows the doctor to remotely login to the locket to view patient's ECG in real time or download the data using a graphical user interface.
The locket is equipped with USB, IrDA and RS232 ports for seamless integration with public networks, mobile phones,
and personal computers. An ultra low power custom made analog integrated circuit (IC) is designed and tested which
performs all the data acquisition & signal conditioning. A low cost polymeric accelerometer technology developed in the
centre is integrated into the electrodes to detect and remove motion artifacts in ambulatory subjects. A pluggable ultrasmall PSTN modem is constructed to transfer data to a remote computer or medical database. A 32-bit system-on-chip
based base-station is also developed as an accessory for the Silicon Locket.
The base station is a handheld system with a higher processing power and a colour TFT LCD panel. The base unit primarily has advanced in-built data management and analysis software for ECG analysis. The silicon locket, developed in
cooperation with the Tata Consultancy Services, is the smallest wearable ECG recorder in the world, for its features.
