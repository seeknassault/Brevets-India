   <h1><center> AN LPG KITCHEN STOVE FOR PERSONS WITHOUT SIGHT</center></h1>
Like sighted people, a blind person also goes to the kitchen and uses this specially designed LPG stove for preparing food for the family. The existing design lacks
ergonomics and user safety aspect.
This problem was addressed through a project taken up by Prof. G. G. Ray and his
colleagues of Industrial Design Centre. Based on a wide survey, in-depth work-content analysis, and observing blind people in the training and rehabilitation centers,
several conceptual designs for LPG stoves were developed. Out of these, six design
concepts have been registered and one of the concepts was developed further for
prototyping.
Salient features:<br>
❁ Low cost two-burner stainless steel gas stove with separate auto igniters.<br>
❁ Auto flame failure detectors for each burner with different tone.<br>
❁ Flame guard ring for each burner with five-prong pan support.<br>
❁ Drip disc around each burner and drip tray underneath the stove.<br>
❁ Easily operational burner control knob with three control positions.<br>
❁ Two step body for easy location of burner and control area.<br>
❁ Reference ridge on the body for easy location of burners and easy repositioning of pan support and flame guard<br>
❁ Central groove on the front surface for keeping vessels<br>
❁ User can replace the battery<br>
❁ Aesthetically pleasing and safe product form and easily serviceable<br>
❁ Can be efficiently used both by the visually handicapped and sighted persons.<br>
The project was sponsored by the Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India.<br>
Product Cost: Approximately Rs. 3,500/- to 4,000/- per stove.

30 stove units have been developed in association with M/s. PK Limited, Hyderabad, and distributed to different
blind persons through organizations like National Association for the Blinds, Rotary Clubs etc. for trial. Design
improvements done and efforts towards commercialization is planned.</b>
