   <h1><center> A NEW LETTERBOX FOR INDIA POST</center></h1>
The old rusty red letterbox, popularly known as "Lal Dabba" just got a new look. This
novel mailbox was developed by Prof. B. K. Chakravarthy and his student of Industrial
Design Centre. New technology based products need investments in tooling and development and the attempt of the project was to provide well designed products in the
public domain.
The letterbox developed has an elegant stainless steel body mounted on a base making
it easy to collect letters because of the overhang of the body. This design also keeps the
letters from being soiled during rains. It has an attractive red composite plastic top with
a beak like aperture for posting letters bringing in an inviting look for the letterbox and
making it identifiable.
The new model including the lock is rust free, does not require painting and has a maintenance free life of 20 years. The top box caps the stainless steel body from all sides,
preventing seepage of rainwater into the letterbox; while the slopes at the top drains
out the water fully. Wide openings to accommodate large envelopes, an easy time slider, a flat top surface which can be used for writing, plus a common key to open all letterboxes in one region, are some
of the additional features of this easy to install letterbox which creates a new identity for India Post.
The brief given by India Post was to design a maintenance free letterbox, since the existing letterboxes which are made
of mild steel were damaged easily and rusted rapidly. As a result the postal department spent a lot of effort and money
in respect of painting, repairing and maintaining them.
The stainless steel body is manufactured using high-end CNC machines where production quality is consistent. The letterbox is packaged in a knock-down condition with the top
and base fitted inside the main body for transportation thus
reducing transportation cost.
As a strategic marketing initiative the new letterbox has large space for advertisements on its sides and the cost of advertisements can pay for the cost of the box for the initial period of 2 years, and later on become a revenue generating activity. This new letterbox was launched on 18th October 2005 in New Delhi. Currently orders are placed for their manufacture for deployment across the country.<br>
