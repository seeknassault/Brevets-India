<h1><center>    PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF OIL WELL CONFIGURATIONS</center></h1>
Oil is found deep below the earth's surface where it is entrapped in porous structures called reservoirs. A miscible or
immiscible liquid is introduced through the wells of the walls of the reservoir which displaces the stored oil and thus oil
is recovered. The configurations of these wells are either horizontal or vertical or a combination of both and their placements is a measure of oil recovery performance. To determine the strategy of oil recovery, a core sample is obtained from
the reservoir and is placed inside a core holder maintained at high temperature and pressure. The core is then saturated with oil and water to levels close to those in the reservoir. Pressure measurements at various locations along the core
are required to track the movement of the fluid front and fine-tune the oil recovery predictions of commercial numerical simulators.
Scientists have been trying to develop an appropriate core holder for the evaluation of oil well configurations and there
are several patents on this. But all these core holders are cylindrical and are restricted for measurement of relative permeability only. Such measurement needs facility for saturating the core with the displacing fluid, which is readily done
by injecting fluid from one end and collecting it from the other end of the cylinder. Also these do not have provisions
for evaluation of fluid flow in the core (rock) along multiple directions.
To solve these problems, Prof. S. K. Mitra of Department of Mechanical Engineering, his colleague from Department of
Chemical Engineering and their students devised a novel three-dimensional core holder with configurations for placement of horizontal and vertical wells in the core, which should also enable saturation of the core sample and allow
multi-point pressure measurement for determining the oil recovery strategy.
The present invention permits fluid flow in a core with different well-configurations to enable their performance evaluation and enables measurement of pressures at various locations on all faces of the core, to provide information to finetune theoretical predictions. It also provides a core holder that can be used for loose material like sand and packed material like rock with the flexibility of putting injector and producer wells at different locations in the core to enables oil
recovery studies for different well lengths. Furthermore, this invention provides a core holder that can be positioned at
any angle with the vertical axis to conduct studies on dip effect and to enable study on multi-lateral wells.
The core holder comprises of a cover and a body that houses the core. The body comprises of side-faces and one bottom-face. The cover and the side-faces of the core holder have bored through holes. These holes permit pressure measurements. To evaluate the performance of oil well-configurations, the porous medium is placed in the core holder and
is uniformly saturated by inserting the fluid into the manifold.<br>
