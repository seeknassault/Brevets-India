  <h1><center>  AUTOMATED WIND SHIELD WIPER</center></h1>
For safe driving, a clean wind shield is an essential requirement. Usually the driver himself activates the wind shield wiper system of his / her vehicle during rain
for clear vision. Several researchers have worked for the development of an automated wind shield wiper system and several patents have been filed on this aspect.
The basic principle of all these automated systems is detecting the water droplets
on the windscreen with an appropriate sensor and then transmitting the signal
to a device to activate the wiping system. But there were several disadvantages
of these automated wiper e.g. inconsistent response, limited speed variation,
extraneous mechanical vibration, partial clearing etc. To resolve all these shortcomings Anish Lohokare, a student of Department of Mechanical Engineering
has developed a user-friendly, reliable and cost effective automatic wiper which
can be regulated, based on the intensity of rainfall and also can be adapted for
use in variety of vehicles. This system is available with a combination for manual option to change the transition from intermittent to continuous wiper speed as
and when required. Moreover, this programmed system is available with a suitable combination of both dwell time variations between two wiping cycles of the wiper and speed control of the wiper motor or continuous operation with speed
control depending on the rainfall intensity and frequency.
The entire process of operation of the automated wiper is described by a schematic diagram. As depicted in the figure,
the system comprises of a rain sensor for rain water measurement which is connected to a detector selection control circuit. The rain-measuring device comprises of a calibrated collection vessel with perforations at specific heights that
enable outflow of water at specific rate collected in the collection vessel at varying amount with the intensity of the rainfall. The control circuit is connected to the wiper motor directly as well as through the wiper operation circuit for the
desired selective operation of the wiper. This detector control circuit is adapted to generate output signals based on the
rain sensor assembly output to selectively activate or deactivate wiper motor driving wipers directly or through the wiper
operation circuit. The wiper operation circuit consists of comparator, intermittent wiper control circuit and continuous
wiper control circuit.<br>
