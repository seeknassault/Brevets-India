 <h1><center>   SURFACE ACTIVE NANOVESICLES AS PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES FOR
RESPIRATORY DISEASES</center></h1>
A complex lipoprotein based substance called pulmonary surfactant lines our lungs and reduces the work of breathing. Due to
dysfunction, in many pediatric and adult respiratory diseases,
there is a need to develop suitable artificial replacements of this
material.
For example, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) is a
life-threatening condition and is a severe form of lung injury.
The alveolar epithelium and vascular endothelium gets damaged and results in the leakage of blood proteins (serum, albumin, fibrinogen) and inflammatory markers in the alveoli. Various
blood proteins like albumin, serum and fibrinogen are potent inhibitors of lung surfactant.<br>
ARDS can also be associated with other diseases like pneumonia, asthma, malaria, dengue and can also be induced by
drugs like bleomycin. Both direct and indirect lung injuries can result in the development of ARDS. Animal derived surfactants are presently used to treat ARDS. In addition, any respiratory condition with surfactant deficiency like Neonatal
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (NRDS) requires treatment with a surfactant. Further, surfactant therapy is also required
for inflammatory lung diseases like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), drug induced respiratory
distress and occupational lung diseases. A large portion of the fatalities related to H1N1 was due to ARDS.<br>
Prof. Rinti Banerjee and her students at the Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering have developed several
nanoparticulate surfactant replacements that can work as artificial lung surfactants and be used as therapy in these respiratory diseases. Lipid based nanovesicles which have the desired surface activity, are biodegradable and safe for in vivo
administration act as platform technologies that can be tailor made for the treatment of surfactant dysfunction seen in
various respiratory diseases. The surface active vesicles can be administered as aerosols and can further be drug loaded
for efficient therapy in many respiratory diseases. These nanoparticles surfactant replacements have the potential to
improve treatment and recovery from ARDS.
