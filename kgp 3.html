  AUTOMATIC ADDRESS SEGMENTATION</center></h1>
Large organizations such as banks, government departments, universities, and corporations need to handle massive
databases of postal addresses. These databases are often poorly structured and frequently accumulate several duplicate entries for the same person. Hence, such organizations periodically engage in a data cleaning or warehousing
activity where addresses are stored in a standard format, with duplicates removed. A key step in this process is address
segmentation that involves extracting from address strings, individual structured fields like 'Landmarks', 'House number', and 'State'. In the less structured Indian addressing system, existing commercial approaches require extensive
manual effort due to various reasons like: non-uniform building numbering schemes, reliance on ad hoc descriptive
landmarks, changing city names, non-standard abbreviations of state names and style of writing addresses, spelling
mistakes and omission of zip codes.
Prof. Sunita Sarawagi of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and her team, have developed a software tool that will 'learn' a model for segmenting unseen addresses when trained with some examples of segmented
addresses. The underlying model is a powerful statistical machine-learning technique that can handle new data robustly, is computationally efficient, and is easy for humans to interpret and tweak in order to rectify the address segmentation problem. Experiments using nationwide, heterogeneous collections of actual addresses showed encouraging results,
with high levels of accuracy.
