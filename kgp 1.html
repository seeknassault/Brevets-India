<h1><center>MICRO-ENGINEERED BIOMEDICAL DEVICES FOR TRANSCATHETRAL AND
ENDOSCOPIC SURGERY</center></h1>
Technology support is vital to the field of minimally invasive surgery.
Miniature optical devices and mechanical manipulators have to be
designed and produced with precision. Prof. J. Bellare of Department of
Chemical Engineering with his colleagues and students have been
active in the areas of optical systems design, including fibre-optic and
micro-optic technology for illumination and visualization, and more
recently, the design of occlusion devices for trans-cathetral surgery. A
vertically integrated fibre-optic plant has been designed at IIT Bombay,
which is capable of drawing light-guide and image-guide fibres. The
fibres are used in end products for light-guide applications, where bundles are made with maximum possible packing density, fused at the
ends into hexagonal close-packed arrangements, and then optically polished using a gantry polisher developed in-house.
The ductus arteriosus represents a communication between the aorta and the pulmonary artery which closes at the time
of birth. Some babies fail to close this connection naturally, so, there is need to close this abnormal connection artificially. A transcatheter closure is done with a micro device implanted at the patent ductus arteriosus site. IIT Bombay has
developed some viable designs which function like a miniature umbrella. The device can travel across a guide-wire and
can be unfurled in place.
