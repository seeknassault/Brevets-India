  <h1><center>  SUPERCRITICAL FLUID EXTRACTION (SCFE) TECHNOLOGY</center></h1>
Worldwide, Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SCFE) is gaining importance
over conventional processes in chemical, pharmaceutical and food processing industry. SCFE technology could not be extensively used commercially due to very high costs and economic viability. Prof. M.
Mukhopadhyay of the Department of Chemical Engineering and her
students have developed world-class SCFE technology in India, to
make it efficient and cost effective. This technology is superior in all
respects and produces high quality extracts and is now made economically viable.
The use of conventional technologies like organic solvent extraction
(using hexane hydroflourocarbons) or steam distillation may not be
appropriate for user industry. Adopting SCFE is the need of the hour for
gaining leadership in the growing world market of value added quality
natural products.
The current global trends show a growing preference for products from natural sources with safe, eco-friendly and pollution free manufacturing processes. SCFE technology provides a ready and total solution to these challenges. Its superiority over the conventional technologies of extraction, especially for natural products in the food and pharmaceutical
industry, is well recognized.
SCFE is a highly versatile technology with a varied range of applications:<br>
❁ Extraction of Natural Products such as Essential oils & Oleoresins, Flavours, Fragrances, Food Colours,
Preservatives, Pesticides and Herbal Medicines etc.<br>
❁ De-cholesterolisation of Food, De-Caffeination of Tea/Coffee, De-Nicotisation and Removal of Tar from Tobacco
and Extraction of Hops<br>
❁ Precision Cleaning of Electronic & Optical Components<br>
❁ Production of Nano-Particles, Chemical Synthesis & Polymer Processing<br>
❁ Processing and preservation of food products
A number of turnkey SCFE projects have been successfully completed till date.<br>
