<h1><center>LOW COST ENGINE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR PETROL-POWERED SMALL VEHICLES</center></h1>
Automobile engine management systems (EMS) refer to the collective unit comprising of sensors, actuators, signal conditioners,
power-amplifiers and a micro-controller (usually termed as the
electronic control unit or "ECU") that perform the functions of realtime engine control and diagnostics. Engine management systems
are designed to enhance fuel economy, reduce tailpipe emissions
and improve overall drivability over the range of operating conditions of interest. Engine management systems supporting fuelinjection operation have become standard in all four-wheelers and
are gaining increasing presence in two/three wheelers. Fuel injection systems offer the benefits of reduced tailpipe emissions,
improved drivability, improved startability and the promise of
improved fuel economy as compared to carbureted solutions.
Prof. S. Suryanarayanan and his team from Department of
Mechanical Engineering have developed an indigenous, fully-functional, low-cost EMS prototype supporting port fuel-injection.
Test results indicate that a vehicle fitted with the IITB EMS solution
produces an order-of-magnitude less hydrocarbon emissions and
similar engine-out carbon monoxide, nitrogen-oxide emissions
when compared to a production-quality carburetion. Further, the
test results indicate the potential for bettering the fuel economy
performance of a production-quality carburetion solution by about
5-10% if the IITB EMS solution is developed further into a production-ready design.
The IITB EMS development effort has led to the proposal of a
minimal sensing architecture for EMS supporting fuel-injection
operation in petrol-powered, single-cylinder small vehicles - over
15 million of which are sold every year around the world. This
research has resulted in arriving at a sensing architecture consisting of a total of three inexpensive sensors which
allow the IITB EMS to meet emissions, fuel economy and drivability performance specifications of today. Further, the
team has shown that this is the least expensive sensing configuration possible for small vehicle EMS solutions. In
addition, the IITB effort has led to the proposal and development of novel control algorithms that exploit the small
size of components of the engine system.
Based on this work on engine management systems SEDEMAC Mechatronics Pvt Ltd has been incubated at IIT Bombay
to realize a commercially-viable production ready prototype of EMS solutions for two, three and four wheelers: This
start-up is dedicated to establish itself as "a globally competent design house, specializing in automotive embedded system products". Particularly, it is focused on building an innovative, fuel-efficient, low-emission automotive engine management system as a product.<br>
