<h1><center>NOVEL HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLE TRANSMISSION</center></h1>
The sharply rising crude oil prices have put a technical challenge
to the automotive sector to reduce fuel consumption.
Automotive business is looking towards electric vehicles to
reduce the dependence on oil. However, battery technology
development has been found deficient to support electric vehicles. Fuel Cell powered vehicles are being sought as permanent
solution but infrastructural demands of transporting hydrogen
currently cloud their progress. Hybrids - assimilation of electric
vehicles and current IC Engine based vehicles - have been shown
to reduce fuel consumption by Toyota, Honda and Ford.
The fundamental difference between a hybrid vehicle and an IC
Engine based (conventional) vehicle lies in their powertrain. A
hybrid uses at least two prime-movers whereas a conventional vehicle uses only one. This implies that the transmission
gearbox be able to accept two inputs rather than one i.e. it needs to be a two degrees-of-freedom mechanism.
Additionally, the gearbox needs to be compact. A planetary gear train (PGT) is the most basic two degrees-of-freedom
mechanism. But a single PGT gearbox (as in Toyota Prius) means that the wheels never receive the full torque of the
prime-mover, whenever the vehicle is being run by a single prime-mover. A compound PGT - with two such basic PGTs
interconnected - then becomes a natural solution.
The current patent pending invention of Prof. B. Seth and his student of Department of Mechanical Engineering, relates
to one such compound PGT meeting all the desirable features
listed above, and harmoniously adds up the power of both the
prime-movers i.e. the recirculating power - that plagues all of
two mechanisms having a power loop - never goes to disastrous
levels. The engine is connected to the transmission via an auxiliary gear-set that lends it the scalability for various types of
engines (gasoline, diesel) or for various categories of vehicles
(hatchbacks, SUVs etc.). Additionally, this auxiliary gear-set
ensures that speed longitude (on torque-speed map) in which
the engine operates is narrow and is at the lower end of speeds
(1200-3000 RPM), a characteristic extremely important for current (as well as those in future) Lean-Burn SI Engines and also
Common-Rail Diesels. Apart from the desirables listed above, the
invented compound PGT allows a fool-proof vehicle operation with varying ratios also.
Schematic of Compound Planetary Gear HEV Transmission
The augmenting control architecture is simple and real-time since it decides based on measurables such as battery SOC,
vehicle speed and change in throttle movement. The decision for gear number in next instance is based on state of these
variables in this instance, thereby devoid of any a priori information of drive cycle and hence implementable. The control architecture exhibits negligible increase in fuel consumed for 25 rounds of NEDC (compared to one round of NEDC).
Further, the controller alters the engine torque contribution based on a "SOC-correction factor" which ensures that the
battery is sufficiently charged always.
The invented transmission is a generic two degrees-of-freedom transmission and not specific to IC Engine and motor
hybrids, hence versatile to be adapted on to a two-motor architecture fuel-cell vehicles.<br><br>
