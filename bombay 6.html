<h1><center>A NOVEL DEVICE TO AID LEARNING OF FRACTIONS AND MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS</center></h1>
Prof. U. A. Athavankar and his student of Industrial Design Centre have invented an educational and entertainment device to learn concepts of fractions and its addition, subtraction and equivalence for children through game and play. Teaching mathematics
with the help of graphical tools is common to hold the learner's attention. The available
games focus more on the demonstrative side directly in limited ways. This device helps
learning fractions of multiple levels of challenge with interactive fun. It allows strategy
based on encouraging creativity, requires 2-4 players and is self-packaged thus making it
easy to carry from place to place.
The game is in the form of a checkered board with demarcated placement of playing tile
pieces of various shapes. The tile pieces must be combined with one another to make
shapes. A designed die is thrown during a turn to determine which fraction tile is to be
used, to complete the shape. The person who completes the final shape with minimum
use of fraction pieces and with minimum throws of dies wins. Every time the die is thrown players pick up a new tile
piece from the pack. The challenge level, learning processes, and sequence can be varied by using varying dies in different numbers giving diverse options.
The device designed at IIT Bombay allows
flexible approach to understand concepts
related to fraction mathematics, through the internalisation of the idea while playing a game.<br>
