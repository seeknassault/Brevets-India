<h1><center>CARBOGEN BREATHING APPARATUS</center></h1>
    
Prof. K. Munshi and his team from the Industrial Design Centre in association with
a DRDO laboratory developed a system of Carbogen delivery for inhalation by persons working under high noise stress. Number of prototypes were developed and
tested extensively with Indian Navy by Defence Institute for Physiology and Allied
Sciences, Delhi. This system has been approved by Indian Navy for use of Jawans
working in severe noise environments.
The system was developed in 3 capacities of 10 lit, 50 lit and 300 lit. The 300 lit
unit has 10 stations and can accommodate 10 persons at a time for inhalation of
Carbogen gas, which is a mixture containing 95% Oxygen and 5% Carbon Dioxide.
Carbogen has a therapeutic role for impaired hearing and relieves the stresses due
to noise pollution. If this is inhaled for 5 minutes, 2-3 times a day, the ill effects of
working in severe noise environments, or noise stress can be eliminated.
It finds extensive use in Defence related environments such as firing ranges, aircraft hangers, ship engine rooms etc and in civil locations such as oxygen bars, traffic islands, fitness centres, workshops, factories etc.<br>
