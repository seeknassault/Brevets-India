    <h1><center>A POINT-OF CARE SYSTEM FOR CARDIAC DIAGNOSTICS</center></h1>
    According to some recent estimates, by 2010, over 60 % of the world's
cardiac patients will be in India. However, cardiac related care is
almost non-existent in the smaller hospitals and primary healthcare
centres, and this project is expected to fulfil this need. The idea is to
develop low-cost diagnostic aids for cardiac dysfunctions. As part of
this vision, there is an ongoing effort by Prof. V. Ramgopal Rao with
colleagues of Department of Electrical Engineering and colleagues of
Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Department of
Chemistry and Department of Mechanical Engineering and their students to develop an integrated system to provide point-of-care diagnostic support for cardiovascular diseases.
The system under development monitors the molecular markers to
detect cardiac attacks, especially the incipient cardiac attacks that go
undetected before major/fatal attacks occur. The system comprises of
"infarcSens" or "iSens", which is a cantilever- and molecular FETbased affinity biosensor array for sensing myocardial infarction and subsequent cardiac status prognosis, using a suite
of molecular markers. A low cost polymeric cantilever technology with embedded electrical readout schemes has been
recently demonstrated in the group with electrical sensitivities in the range of a few ppm per nanometer of deflection,
suitable for cardiac marker sensing. The sensing electronics is already in place while the associated data management
software for tracking the markers with time, required for creating an epidemiological database, is currently under
development.<br><br>
