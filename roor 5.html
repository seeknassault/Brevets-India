 <h1><center>   ATM ENCLOSURE DESIGN</center></h1>
ASAN, a low cost Automated Teller Machine (ATM) was launched in December 2003. Prof.
U. A. Athavankar and his colleagues of the Industrial Design Centre designed the product,
based on a survey of current and potential users interviewed for their views on existing
ATMs. ASAN has several advantageous features over the currently deployed ATMs to suit
the Indian customer and settings.
The attractive new design incorporating elements from traditional Indian architecture
departs from the current neutral appearance of ATMs. Banks may further customize it based
on their needs. The small size makes it suitable for deployment in places with space constraints. ASAN's ergonomic design suits the typical Indian body dimensions with respect to
the height of the keypad and the inclination of the screen. Additionally, the machine has a
provision for keeping one's personal belongings, and protruding wings for ensuring privacy during transactions. A multi-coloured card reader status indicator guides users unfamiliar with new technology.
The machine has intelligent power-saving hardware and software. An integrated pedestal accommodates a
Uninterrupted Power Supply, providing maximum availability during outages. The robust engineering design ensures
trouble-free operation in hot, humid and dusty environments. Additionally, a unique airflow system allows deployment
at non-air conditioned sites. Such features make it suitable for interior locations. Other features include, 40-column
graphics thermal receipt printer, secure encrypting PIN pad and a flat panel screen.
