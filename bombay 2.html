<h1><center>ENGINEERED ECOSYSTEMS FOR WASTE MANAGEMENT</h1></center>
    Organic wastes from human and animal habitations
can accumulate in and endanger the environment.
Engineered ecosystems research for waste conversion has led to the development of Vermiculture
Technology at IIT Bombay, developed by Prof. H. S.
Shankar and his students of Department of
Chemical Engineering. This process overcomes the
problems associated with conventional methods
such as solid state composting, activated sludge, and
extended aeration in which bio-energy gets dissipated. It engages an ecology consisting of soil, plants and soil micro and macro-organisms including geophagous earthworms.
The process obtains synergy between
photosynthesis and respiration, so that
bio-energy of wastes is fully utilized.
Facilitated through initial support by
the Department of Biotechnology, the
process has major potential in City farming, Animal husbandry, Agriculture, Wasteland development and Agro-industrial waste processing.
Bio-reactor for Recycling of Waste Water
Engineered ecosystems may also be used for treatment of liquid wastes. Cultured Soil Filter Technology developed for
this purpose consists of impervious containment
(typically 1.0 - 1.5m below ground), and incorporates soil, filtration media, soil organisms like
earthworms, and plants.
Features
<br>
❁ A cost-effective 'green' technology, suitable for all solid and liquid organic waste<br>
❁ Very low energy consumption<br>
❁ Bio-mineral fertilizers and soil as by-products<br>
❁ No sludge production, unlike conventional units<br>
❁ Self-sustaining revenue model
Applications<br>
❁ Treatment of water for irrigation, construction, and soil application<br>
❁ Industrial effluent treatment<br>
❁ Processing solid wastes<br>
❁ Non-chemical purification of swimming pools and drinking water<br><br>
The technology has been adopted by several user organisations.
Based on the above novel technology patented both in India and USA, Vision Earthcare has been incubated in IIT
Bombay for deploying this technology. This company provides products and services in the area of water & air purification and soil & sanitation.
