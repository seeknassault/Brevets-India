    <h1><center>SOFTWARE FOR RAILWAY OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT</center></h1>

The suburban railway system on which Mumbai is
heavily dependent, has been rightly called the lifeline of the city. Railway operations present a huge
range of problems to work on. For the past several
years, Prof. N. Rangaraj, IEOR with his colleagues
from Department of Computer Science &
Engineering and Department of Chemical
Engineering have been working on various aspects
of suburban railway operations management.
Line Capacity Simulator for the Indian Railways
Institute of Signal Engineering and
Telecommunications has been developed to represent the operational features of trains in selected sections. The simulator can help estimate the capacity of long-distance track segments on the railway network under complex
traffic conditions. It is also useful in changing time-tables, analyzing the effect of adding scheduled trains in a section, evaluating investment at a local level (such as additional loop lines and platforms), and studying the effects of signal failures
and train delays. Essentially the programme uses priority-based scheduling of trains along with the operating constraints
of track occupancies and platform availability.
The simulator also allows realistic analyses by reproduction of the operational logic of railway movement, and related
engineering details. It also records train speeds that depend on track signal conditions, which in turn depend on the status of several trains ahead of the signal. The simulator can display train movements on a distance vs. time graph with
details of individual trains.
Rake Management System (RMS) is a set of utilities and tools designed for analysis and decision-making on the
overall use of rakes vis-a-vis their deployment, operation, and maintenance cycles for suburban train services.<br><br>
