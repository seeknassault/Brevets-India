    <h1><center>HARDER CUTTING EDGE</center></h1>

In order to increase the hardness of articles, steel can be coated with diamond. Diamond
coated steel components find applications in cutting or grinding tools, abrasive wheels,
end mills or load bearing elements such as ball-bearings or types of inserts. One of the
processes of coating steel components with diamond is by Chemical Vapour Deposition
(CVD). This process does not make the quality of steel hardness as good because of the formation of graphite layer in steel. Other known processes using metal coats have been tried
to tackle this problem with unfavourable results. The main issue to improve hardness
would be to improve the adhesion of diamond on steel. Prof. D. S. Misra of Department of
Physics, and his student, have devised a method to coat steel that improves the quality of
diamond coat on steel components, thus enhancing adhesion and resultant hardness.
The steel surface is initially cleaned by washing the components with detergent, followed
by deionized water. Next the components are washed with an aqueous alkali solution and
then deionized water. Lastly, to remove oxides on the outer layer of steel, electro-cleaning
or anodic cleaning is done using a sulphuric acid bath. The clean component is further electroplated with a layer of nickel, a nickel - diamond composite layer and a chromium layer followed by chemical vapour deposition coating of diamond.
The three pre-layers are thermally stable. The nickel layer enhances the second nickel-diamond coating and chromium
helps in adhering of diamond very well. These layers have helped to solve the problem of poor adhesion due to formation of graphite cluster on bare steel formed during CVD. Carbon does not diffuse into the three-layer coated steel. This
improved adhesion was verified using scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and micro-hardness gauging
methods, showing good adhesion and thus greater hardness.<br><br>
